Loan Credibility Prediction System using Data Mining Techniques
As we know that now-a-days there is a rapid 
growth in banking sector, resulting lots of people are applying 
for bank loans. Finding out the applicant to whom the loan 
will be approved is a difficult process. Data mining 
techniques are becoming very popular nowadays because 
of the wide availability of huge quantity of data and the need 
for transforming such data into knowledge. Techniques of 
data mining are implemented in various domains such as
retail industry, telecommunication industry, biological data 
analysis, etc. In this paper, we proposed a model which 
predicts loan approval/rejection of an applicant using data 
mining techniques. This can be done by training the model 
with the data of the previous records of the people applied for
loan
